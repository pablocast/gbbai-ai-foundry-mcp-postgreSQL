- **Zava DuraShield Coating**: Self-healing capabilities

### 2. Unique Sensory Characteristics
- **Visual**: Color changes, iridescent qualities, phosphorescent effects
- **Auditory**: Specific frequency humming (15.7kHz), subtle sounds
- **Olfactory**: Signature scents (pine/vanilla, cinnamon, herbal)
- **Tactile**: Temperature changes, tingling sensations, static buildup

### 3. Regional Adaptations
- Pacific Northwest moisture conditions
- Mountain region temperature variations
- Coastal salt environment optimization
- Freeze-thaw cycle formulations
- Desert climate UV protection

### 4. Enhanced Performance Metrics
- Specific test results beyond industry standards
- Unique measurement criteria (e.g., "Flexibility at -40Â°F: Passes 1000 bend cycles")
- Performance percentages that exceed conventional products
- Environmental impact metrics with positive benefits

### 5. Installation Quirks & Procedures
- Unconventional but believable installation requirements
- Specific tool recommendations (Zava ZVT-3000 tester)
- Timing considerations (lunar phases, settling periods)
- Environmental condition requirements

### 6. Zava-Specific Documentation
- Custom safety standards (ZS-E001, ZS-E002, etc.)
- Proprietary testing laboratories
- Unique customer support channels (1-800-ZAVA-QUIRK)
- Distinctive certifying authorities

### 7. Environmental Benefits Beyond Standards
- Carbon sequestration properties
- Beneficial effects on soil and water
- Support for beneficial insect populations
- Zero waste manufacturing processes

## Document Types Enhanced

### Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
- Added Zava-specific hazard codes (Z001, Z002, Z003)
- Enhanced first aid procedures with product-specific notes
- Unique physical and chemical properties
- Proprietary composition information

### Compliance Certificates
- Zava-specific testing standards and laboratories
- Enhanced test results with proprietary metrics
- Distinctive certifying authorities
- Extended validity periods with surveillance requirements

### Installation Quirks Documents (New)
- Product-specific installation oddities and tips
- Troubleshooting guides for "enhanced features"
- Customer support for unusual behaviors
- Category-specific installation notes

### Environmental Impact Statements (New)
- Detailed lifecycle assessments
- Third-party certifications and awards
- Supply chain sustainability metrics
- Environmental technology benefits

## RAFT Training Benefits

These enhancements make the documents ideal for RAFT training because they:

1. **Contain Novel Information**: The quirks and technologies are not present in existing LLM training data
2. **Maintain Believability**: All enhancements are plausible within the hardware domain
3. **Provide Rich Context**: Multiple interconnected details support comprehensive understanding
4. **Include Domain Expertise**: Technical specifications and procedures require specialized knowledge
5. **Feature Consistent Branding**: Zava-specific elements create coherent fictional universe
6. **Demonstrate Relationships**: Products and technologies reference each other logically

## Usage for RAFT

When using these documents for RAFT training:

1. **Retrieval Queries**: Focus on Zava-specific technologies and procedures
2. **Fine-tuning Targets**: Use the unique characteristics and performance metrics
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Leverage the interconnected product ecosystem
4. **Technical Details**: Utilize the specific measurements and test results
5. **Troubleshooting**: Train on the quirky but logical behavior explanations

The enhanced documents provide a rich foundation for training models to understand and work with domain-specific technical documentation that goes beyond generic industry knowledge.
